   * Default implementation for optional initializer method

   * Function initialization refers to the process of initializing a 
   * function when it is called, including setting the initial state
   * of the function, allocating resources, or assigning initial 
   * values ​​to variables within the function.
   * 
   * FunctionGraph performs function initialization after the function 
   * instance is successfully started. Only after the initialization is
   * successfully executed can the function instance start processing
   * function call requests.
   * 
   * FunctionGraph ensures that a function instance only successfully 
   * executes function initialization once during its life cycle. 
   * The execution time of function initialization will also be measured, 
   * and users need to pay for it. 
   * 
   * The billing method is the same as the function call processing.
   * 
   * In general scenarios, business logic that can be shared by multiple
   * request processing is suitable for being placed in the initialization
   * function to reduce function latency. For example, loading a large-scale
   * model in a deep learning scenario or building a connection pool in a
   * database scenario.
